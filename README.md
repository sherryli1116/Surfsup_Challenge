# Surfsup_Challenge
## Overview
### Purpose
W. Avy wants to start a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii selling surfboards and icecreams to local tourists. Therefore, he wants to learn more about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. So the main purpose for this analysis is to help him find out important data points of June and December in order to help him to make business decisions.
## Results
### June temperature dataframe:

### December temperature dataframe:

- Temperature in Oahu in June and December could reach to maximum 85°F.
- Temperature in Oahu could go down to 56°F in December.
- The average temperature between June and December in Oahu is relatively small.
## Summary
From the results above, we could see that there is not much a difference in temperature between June and December so the data reflected are not giving us enough information. Although we know the maximum and minimum temperature in both months, we still do not know which business we should focus on in these two months. Therefore, we could also run two queries of the precipitation in June and December to see if people would spend more time in shop getting icecreams or outside surfing.
